          <h2>Why $35.55?</h2>
          <p>Most dealerships advertise oil changes as low as $19.99, then tack on shop supplies, environmental fees, filter charges, and tax at checkout. The real cost ends up north of $60. We think that is a terrible way to treat customers.</p>
          <p>At Toyota of Coconut Creek, we set one honest price: $35.55 for a full-synthetic oil and filter change with everything included. You will never see a surprise line item on your invoice. We believe when the price is fair from the start, you do not need gimmicks to earn repeat business.</p>
